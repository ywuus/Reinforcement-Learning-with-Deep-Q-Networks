# Reinforcement Learning with Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

The Reinforcement Learning with Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is a Python class that implements the DQN algorithm for reinforcement learning tasks. It allows agents to learn optimal policies through interaction with an environment using Q-learning and deep neural networks.

## Usage:

1. Initialize the DQNAgent object with the state shape and action size.
2. Interact with the environment by selecting actions using the `act` method.
3. Train the agent using the `train` method with experience tuples.

## Features:

- Utilizes deep neural networks to approximate Q-values for state-action pairs.
- Implements epsilon-greedy action selection for exploration and exploitation.
- Supports training with experience replay and target networks for stability.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
